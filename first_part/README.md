# Part 1 - Algorithm

## Background information for this exercise:
Assume that the channel engagement platform is a mobile or tablet application. 
- Flyers have unique identifiers 
- Merchants have unique identifiers
- Merchants have multiple flyers

You have been given a sample dataset with the following schema: [timestamp, user_id, event, flyer_id, merchant_id]. 
There are a number of events which the mobile app collects as the shoppers the app. These are the 'event" types in the preceding schema.

Your task is to:
1. Compute the average time on flyer per user.
2. Next, generate an output that will back a Business Intelligence (Bl) report that will be shared with our merchant partners.
3.  Explain how your algorithm scales for:
   - 1 Million Events (~10 MB of data) 
   - 1 Trillion Events (~10 TB of data)
To write your algorithm, you may use any of: Python, Java.
